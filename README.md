# scripted
Simple Linux shell script editor

Work in progress...

I have made this to help me with making shell scripts.\
Written in Gambas Basic http://gambas.sourceforge.net/
gambas3 needs to be installed.

But it functional now so uploading it here for anyone else to examine/use/upgrade/whatever.

Main Features..

* Lists all script functions in a convenient list you can click the function names and the editor jumps to the function.
* Will relaunch asking for root permissions if needed for a protected file.
* Uses the Gambas3 TextEditor object that has a few handy features that have been far from fully implemented yet.
* custom colour coding.
* has a Run button to save and launch the script in a TerminalView object.

Like I say this has been made to help me when making shell scripts.

Known bugs...\
Search box is rubbish, gotta work on that.\
Selecting "sh" highlighting mode will only work on my fork of gambas at present. Hoping the sh higlighting will be added to the main gambas branch.\
